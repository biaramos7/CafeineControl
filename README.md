# CaffeineControl

This project provides two endpoints for our mobile app's frontend team: one for accessing a list of coffee options and another for calculating and offering recommendations on when and what to drink next. These recommendations are tailored to help users maintain their caffeine levels at an optimal range during study sessions, ensuring they stay alert and focused without overindulging or experiencing caffeine crashes.
